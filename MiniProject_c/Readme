This is my mini project in college. Kindly consider this.
The computer had seen a lot of evolution both in hardware and software
Sides, yet there are some features which remain unbeatable and one among
them is the structure oriented programming language or C. Apart from
computer Programming they are fused in circuit boards, microcontrollers..,
etc to carry out Specified functions. The reason is the elegance and
simplicity of the keywords used in c.

This project is about Controlling Home/Industrial Appliance with
computer using C. This idea is evolved from the in-out features of
microcontroller. The same can be extended to a PC where the output from
PC is a pulse which will activate a relay and hence controlling
electrical/electronic appliance. This is possible in all PCs having printer port
